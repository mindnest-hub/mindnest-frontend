 • Parties determine who makes decisions that affect your daily life—schools, roads, healthcare, taxes, security.
 • Weak parties mean decisions are left to the powerful few, often called godfathers.

 • Know the parties' rules, processes, and ideology
 • Join, observe, or participate in local party structures
