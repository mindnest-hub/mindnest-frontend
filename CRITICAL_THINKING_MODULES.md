## Module 13: Teach a Friend Details

**Purpose:** Kids learn by teaching concepts in their own words

**How it works:**
1. Kid sees a question (e.g., "Why do we need to drink water?")
2. Types explanation as if teaching a friend
3. AI evaluates based on keywords and effort
4. Receives encouraging feedback (always positive)

**Topics:**
1. Why do we need to drink water?
2. Why should we be kind to others?
3. Why do plants need sunlight?
4. Why is it important to tell the truth?

**Feedback System:**
- ✅ Good explanation (2+ keywords or 30+ characters): Praise + confetti + 50 coins
- 💪 Needs improvement: Encouraging hint + guidance

**Educational Value:**
- Feynman Technique (learn by teaching)
- Builds confidence
- Reinforces understanding
- Always encouraging, never discouraging
